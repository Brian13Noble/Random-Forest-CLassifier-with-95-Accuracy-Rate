**Project Abstract**
Obesity is a silent pandemic that continues to affect both developed and developing worlds socially and economically. The problem is characterized by excessive weight gain, which triggers other health challenges such as diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems and mental health problems that arise from esteem issues and physical inactivity, among others. Recent developments in research focus more on predicting diseases based on factors such as gender, age, weight, family history, consumption patterns, and exercize, among others. This project aims to borrow concepts from Machine Learning to build a Random Classifier that can predict the obesity level of an individual based on the important features. Early detection and treatment of obesity and other chronic ailments are increasingly becoming important, considering that the consequences are dire at later stages of life. The dataset for the project was obtained from the Kaggle website (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fatemehmehrparvar/obesity-levels). The data contains both categorical and continuous variables. The target variable (obesity level) is categorical, making it fit to build a random forest classifier. The dataset participants were from Mexico, Peru, and Colombia, and 23% of the data was collected directly from the users through a web platform. In comparison, 77% of the data was collected using a Weka tool and a SMOTE filter.
